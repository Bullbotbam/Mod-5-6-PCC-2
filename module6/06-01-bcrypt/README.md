# Information Security with HelmetJS - BCrypt

This is the boilerplate for the BCrypt lessons. Instructions for completing these lessons start on PCC Module 6 - submodule 1.

To complete these challenge - make sure you log you hashed passwords to ensure they are hashing properly. 

Rememeber, hashing is a ONE WAY algorithm - we cannot get the original string back from the hash - we can only 
compare the hashed password to a hashed user input - and see if they match.
