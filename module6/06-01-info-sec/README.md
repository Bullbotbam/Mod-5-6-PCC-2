# Information Security with HelmetJS

This is the boilerplate for the Information Security lessons. Instructions for completing these lessons start PCC Module 6 - Submodule 1. 


For this submodule - only edit the myApp.js file. 


Considering the limitations of PCC / Local completion of this module - the node modules have been npm installed for you already.
Once you complete all the challenges - the server should be able to run / listen on port 300 successfully without crashing. 

Please verify the required packages are installed as you go through this submodule by checking the package.json file.



# NOTE: in a Express project where you would want to use helmet.js - you would install this using the terminal command :

#                npm install helmet
